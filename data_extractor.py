The input data is a list of dictionaries. 
data = []
A dictionary is unique for each patient visit and build as follows:
pat_visit = dict()
pat_visit['Id'] = i   Unique patient visit identifier (int)
pat_visit['text'] = [] List of list of list of all clinical codes. 
For instance for 2 time periods, 3 contacts the list looks like as follows;
[[[a,b],[c,d],[e,f]],[[a1,b1],[c1,d1,d2,e4],[NA]]]
Here, [a,b] are the clinical codes appearing in context 0 in time period 0
[c1,d1,d2,e4] are the clinical codes appearing in context 1 in time period 1
The number of time periods and contexts should be the same for all patient visits.
The number of clinical codes inside the context may vary.
If there is no code in any context, add "NA"
pat_visit['Label_multi'] = [] List of all label IDs (int)
pat_visit['catgy'] = [] List with only one primary label ID (int) 
Finally, data.append(pat_visit)
Save data as a pkl file "ehr_input.pkl"
